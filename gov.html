                        During my tenure as Lead Designer for the Portuguese Government, I've had the privilege of collaborating with diverse teams on a multitude of projects and formats. Despite this variety, one common thread binds them all: the responsibility of crafting communication materials that resonate with citizens. Central to this endeavor is the imperative to convey not just a clear message but also the gravity inherent in governmental communication.

                            When I first embarked on this journey within the government, much of the existing framework was outdated. Moreover, my entry coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating rapid adaptation without the luxury of time for extensive visual restructuring. Nonetheless, there was a concerted effort to overhaul the Design Guidelines Manual, establishing updated principles to guide our communication strategies moving forward.

A recurring task involved generating content for the Government's social media platforms, primarily the official page. Additionally, it was necessary to develop content that could be easily replicated by other ministries seeking to engage on social media. To facilitate this, I crafted simple yet distinctive layouts characterized by a white border frame and a carefully selected color palette. Given the scarcity of designers across many ministries, it was essential to create a model that could be effortlessly replicated by anyone. Without any specific budgetting alocated for aquiring fonts or image assets, we had to rely solely on open source, free materials.

                            Another frequent responsibility involved designing backdrops and podiums for the numerous day-to-day events held across all ministries. Whether within the ministry building or at off-site venues, there was a consistent need to adapt these backdrops to varying dimensions, materials, and logistical circumstances. Initially, these designs incorporated a significant amount of information, prioritizing the prominent display of logos for television broadcasts. However, over time, we streamlined the designs, opting to showcase the logo solely on the podium while minimizing visual clutter to allow for clear presentations alongside speakers.

Undoubtedly, the pandemic presented unparalleled communication challenges. With evolving rules and information regarding citizen mobility, safety protocols, and scheduling, all content had to be rapidly produced. This included constant televised briefings, presentations with explanatory graphs, and dissemination of new regulations.

Given the necessity of remote communication, there was a heightened focus on the government's social media accounts. Through these channels, citizens accessed weekly summaries of government announcements. My role extended beyond content creation; I also coordinated with internal and external teams to ensure swift dissemination of critical information.

To enhance immediacy and comprehension, we opted for bold, solid colors. This color-coding system, ranging from red to yellow to green, conveyed the urgency and severity of the communicated messages.

The Prime Minister's briefings were a regular occurrence, typically on a weekly basis, eagerly anticipated by the populace for updates on new measures. These briefings constituted a significant communication event, accessible to virtually everyone with access to TV, internet, or radio. In my role, I was tasked with developing the Prime Minister's presentations and creating accompanying visuals tailored to the key messages conveyed during the briefings.

These messages were meticulously crafted in collaboration with teams of psychological behavior specialists. Their insights guided us in effectively communicating the importance of caution during uncertain times, ensuring the populace remained informed and vigilant.
During the initial stages of the pandemic, we recognized the effectiveness of repeatedly emphasizing three simple rules to help people remember safety behaviors. To ensure maximum retention, we chose to maintain the color blue, which not only aligned with the government's primary communication color but also conveyed a calming and reassuring message.

        During the most critical stage of the pandemic, the Prime Minister requested the creation of a color-coded graph to visually depict the evolution of the pandemic in the country during briefings. This graph served to justify the necessity of certain measures being implemented. I was responsible for developing the risk matrix, which not only featured prominently in the briefings but also became a fixture in daily reports from the Ministry of Health.

        To ensure accessibility for all citizens, the matrix was meticulously adapted to accommodate various forms of color blindness, guaranteeing accurate perception of the information presented. Additionally, I created an explanatory video detailing the functionality of the matrix. This video was broadcasted on TV and shared across government social media platforms, enhancing public understanding of the data presented.

Following the conclusion of the pandemic, the onset of the Russian invasion in Ukraine presented a new set of challenges for governmental communication. With the urgent need to accommodate platforms and disseminate information for Ukrainian citizens seeking asylum in Portugal, we faced a race against time. Collaborating closely with the communication team, we swiftly developed a website, designed social media communication strategies, and created leaflets to be included in welcome kits distributed at airports. This rapid response ensured that crucial information was readily available and accessible to those in need during a tumultuous period.

To unify all program information, a new logo was crafted, blending the colors of Portugal and Ukraine. Given the gravity of the subject matter, we juxtaposed the vibrancy of the logo with a dark blue backdrop for displaying information. This strategic contrast ensured both visual appeal and clarity, emphasizing the importance of the content being conveyed.

              Following the conclusion of the pandemic, the government made the decision to host monthly minister council meetings in various cities across Portugal, aiming to promote decentralization of political action. To brand this initiative, a simple and direct logo was requested. Additionally, for further personalization, each logo was updated to reflect the city being visited. These logos were then incorporated into videos, backdrops, stands, and rollups. The inclusion of the term "+ Próximo" emphasized the importance of proximity and community engagement within the initiative.

                Amidst the housing crisis, there arose a pressing need for continuous communication regarding the government's measures to address it. To streamline this communication, a simple logo was swiftly created to serve as a central branding element for all related initiatives. The decision was made to maintain some consistency with the logo developed for "Governo Mais Próximo," including the use of the same font.

                Yellow was incorporated as an accent color alongside the blue, providing contrast where necessary across all communication materials. As with most programs, the logo had to be adaptable to various content formats, including presentations, backdrops, stands, leaflets, documents, and construction site posters. This ensured cohesive branding and effective dissemination of information across diverse platforms.

Following the government's reelection in 2022, a decision was made to revisit the visual guidelines and logo. This collaborative effort involved both a Design Agency and the internal team, which included myself. Our collective responsibility was to oversee the entire process, from conception to swift implementation.

After careful consideration, a simplified version of the previous logo was selected, ushering in a comprehensive visual system to accompany it. This streamlined approach aimed to ensure consistency and clarity across all government communications. New proprietary typography was developed, which is used across all communication assets.
