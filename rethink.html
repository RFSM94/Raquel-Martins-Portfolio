                        <span class="i">(Re)thinking (Re)doing (Re)acting</span> is a website which gathers projects from the 1st year of the Master’s in Communication Design (Belas-Artes, ULisboa) that highlight ethical and aesthetic issues emerging from the ubiquity of computational infrastructures and the massive impact of the internet on contemporary culture. The projects gathered on the website highlight current challenges in design thinking and practice, questioning canonical views of the discipline and exploring the discursive potential of academic production. They creatively address the confluence of print and online digital media in the production, preservation and dissemination of knowledge.

The creation of this website was a collaborative effort, made possible by the input of all students involved. Through lively debates and idea exchanges, we collectively shaped the vision for the final project's website. Organizing into several teams, my role was focused on web development and establishing the visual identity.

  <p>They reflect on how digital technologies shape our perception and experience of reality, evoking current applications and implications of artificial intelligence systems in emulating human capabilities and their consequent incorporation of social biases. They also highlight the volatility of knowledge under the impact of the internet and reflect on the modes of communication, action, and inaction that social networks promote.</p></div>
