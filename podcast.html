                        <a class="link" href="https://observador.pt/">Observador</a>, the leading generalist online newspaper in Portugal, embarked on a new venture in 2019: launching a radio station and accompanying podcasts. Their aim? To maintain their reputation as digital pioneers in the market—innovative, distinct, and of high quality.
                        <br><br>
                        I was tasked with creating a visual identity that would be instantly recognizable across various platforms (including podcasts on Spotify, social media posts, website highlights) while also standing out amidst the competition, firmly entrenched in consumers' minds over the years.
                        <br><br>
                        A crucial objective for this project was to establish a timeless visual system adaptable to any subject, given the radio's broad scope and potential for future growth. It was imperative that the structure be easy for other teams to consistently implement over time across diverse topics.

    As the creative lead, I collaborated closely with the editor-in-chief, section editors, photographers, and programmers to devise an overarching strategy, design a visual system, and ensure its seamless and continuous implementation.
    <br><br>
    Focusing on functionality, we aimed to maintain a fresh appearance while upholding brand credibility. Readability and appeal were paramount, considering the crowded landscape of podcasts from established media outlets.
    <br><br>
    After assessing the initial lineup of podcasts, our next step was to develop a functional visual system. The vibrant yet minimalist design enables easy recognition of each category at a glance, aiding in mental organization for listeners.

  <p>Observador wanted to highlight their main political podcast in a special way. 
    For this, I created a label inspired by the Campbell’s soup can, with the name of the Podcast: “Vichyssoise” - a soup with a special story in the Portuguese political scene: In '93, Paulo Portas (then a journalist) said of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (politician) that he was an unreliable source for since he had given an account of a political VIP dinner that had never taken place, going as far as inventing that the soup served during the dinner was Vichyssoise. 
    
    The allusion to Campbell’s soup was the perfect metaphor between its original purpose of being available to everyone and our goal of making political interviews and analyses made easy and accessible for all.</p></div>
