                        The internet has undergone exponential growth, with posts emerging as its fundamental unit, birthing the ubiquitous feed. But what defines this feed? No longer separate from humanity, the digital realm is intricately woven into our lives. As we are shaped by our consumption, the ramifications of unconscious digital intake loom large. Technology and power are inextricably linked: the former a tool, the latter its culmination. Yet, in a landscape of ever-evolving technology, ignorance breeds vulnerability to subversion.

    <div class="project-info pa4 mb7 pa3-xs">
      <p>To probe these complexities, one must grasp the interplay between posts and feeds, and confront the ramifications of our passive absorption of information. In <span class="i">(Tr)End(y) Feed,</span> inspired by the <a class="link" href="https://soulellis.com/writing/nov2017/">insights of Paul Soulellis</a>, my objective is to spotlight the consequential nature of inadvertent content consumption, through a publication which confronts my own feed with scholar's analysis on the topic. Unconscious content consumption not only perpetuates the <span class="i">status quo</span> but also fortifies media and personal agendas. What terrain are we sculpting within our feeds, as they thrive on the content we supply? We feed the post, the post feeds the feed, and the feed, in turn, nourishes us. These questions form the crux of our project, delving into Twitter trends as a tangible case study, exploring how discourses and narratives proliferate within this platform's dynamic feed. </p></div>

      <p>Despite the platform's opaque selection criteria for trending topics, purportedly based on user profiles and engagement, skepticism abounds. This project juxtaposes my own feed samples against analyses by other scholars, shedding light on the underlying issues. This endeavor aims to disrupt the incessant flow described by Soulellis, prompting deeper reflection on our interaction with digital content. Understanding the feed's societal impact is imperative; unconscious consumption bears consequences, necessitating scrutiny of our digital diet. <span class="i">(Tr)end(y) Feed</span> is an invitation to this reflection.
