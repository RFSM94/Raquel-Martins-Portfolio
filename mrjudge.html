    <span class="i">Operação Marquês</span> unfolded as an investigation that evolved into legal action against José Sócrates, Portugal's former Prime Minister, accused of qualified tax fraud, money laundering, and passive corruption.

    Throughout its various stages, one pivotal moment was José Sócrates' interrogation regarding his lifestyle and financial sources. Although this event wasn't televised or made public, given its significance, Observador embarked on a project to produce a series of videos utilizing real trial transcripts. This undertaking involved collaboration between journalists and the multimedia team.
    
    As the lead designer and animator, I collaborated closely with a journalist from the multimedia team, our coordinator, and the lead reporter. I conceptualized an overarching visual identity for the series, with each interrogation chapter released as a daily episode.

        With no access to visual materials from the trial, I had to devise a method to bring the lengthy proceedings to life in a captivating and dynamic manner, relying solely on image animation and audio recordings. Two actors were enlisted to portray the characters through audio recordings, providing the basis for my animation work. To animate the characters effectively, I utilized a collection of images of the former Prime Minister, manipulating them to match the emotions conveyed in the audio recordings, essentially animating them like puppets.

          We aimed to infuse the project with a lighthearted touch to offset the seriousness of the case, leveraging the often humorous nature of the statements. This was achieved through the use of saturated, vibrant colors, lively music, and the dynamic manipulation of images.
