                        Every four years, Portugal holds national elections to determine not only the next government but also the constitution of parliament.

Despite the significance of this event, a considerable portion of the population — particularly younger generations—tends to abstain from voting and remain uninformed about the issues and political parties. As a news media outlet, the main goal was to provide comprehensive coverage of the elections in a simple, engaging, and accessible manner to reach a broader audience, particularly those who find politics daunting. This endeavor involved not only journalists but also the multimedia team.

As the lead designer, I collaborated closely with the multimedia team, our coordinator, chief editor, publisher, and the political department to develop a cohesive visual identity and system to be implemented across all newspaper formats (articles, videos, animations, podcasts).

    Our strategy revolved around embracing diversity and individuality, mirroring the vibrant spectrum of voices in parliament. I employed lively colors and dynamic lines to illustrate the diverse political landscape, with circles representing political parties free to move within the parliamentary space.

    In addition to my design role, I conceptualized and produced short animations to complement videos recorded by our videographers, aiding in the explanation of various political measures and enhancing citizens' understanding of the stakes involved in the elections.
    Adapting this visual style for digital platforms involved creating intros, lower thirds for videos, and covers for articles, podcasts, and animations.

    We aimed for the project's personality and execution to reflect democratic values: transparent communication, collaboration, and appreciation of diversity. To achieve this, I utilized saturated colors, whimsical illustrations, and bold typography to craft a cohesive visual system encompassing brand identity, custom illustrations, and explanatory videos.
